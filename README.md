# HR-Analytics
# 🎯Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition using SQL by identifying key factors that influence why employees leave an organization. Through the use of CTEs, window functions, and analytical queries, this project aims to uncover trends and patterns related to salary, job roles, experience, satisfaction levels, and work-life balance to support data-driven HR decision-making.

2. Employee demographics: Age, Gender, AgeGroup, Marital Status
